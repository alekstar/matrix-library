Class Matrix where basic operations with matrices are included.

Notes:
- There are methods isEmpty() and isNull() in Matrix class:

    An empty matrix is a matrix in which the number of rows or columns (or both) 
    is zero. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(mathematics)#Empty_matrices)

    I decided to use isNull() method to determine if matrix has no rows and 
    columns (number of rows and columns is zero).
